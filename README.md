This project utilizes [ultibo](https://ultibo.org) running on a raspberry pi to implement a photo slide show on an HDMI display (usually a television). Ultibo provides a system for programming pascal on bare hardware.

An working list of available ultibo units and the status for each unit's inclusion in the dec15 milestone is in [ultibounits.md](https://github.com/markfirmware/ultibo-slideshow/blob/master/ultibounits.md) - this list was derived from the [ultibo wiki status page](https://ultibo.org/wiki/Current_Status)
